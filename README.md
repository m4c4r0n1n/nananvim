<img width="1319" height="1376" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f47d7df-7692-4e4a-8974-d325f8219308" />

A minimal Neovim config that actually works. Built primarily for Arch but works on most Linux distros and MacOS. I'm just one nana-man trying to make a decent config, so bear with me if something's janky or whatever. I built this for fun and to make a small config that's a bit beefier with useful shit without bloat all while keeping it easy to customize. The idea is to have the most over-glorified nvim config dots possible that are easily customizable should someone else ever decide to give them a shot. Pretty minimal, easy for those who don't want to spend all day configuring neovim to act like an IDE. Should you trust a solo dude's configs for nvim? Hell yes.

## What's in it?

- **Snacks.nvim**: Dashboard on startup, plus a file picker that can preview images, PDFs, and more right in your terminal (if you're using Kitty)
- **Treesitter**: Better syntax highlighting and code navigation for 20+ languages
- **LSP**: Language servers auto-install through Mason (Lua, Python, TypeScript, C/C++, HTML/CSS/JSON out of the box)
- **Telescope**: Fuzzy finder for live grep, buffers, help tags, and more
- **Rose Pine Moon**: Beautiful theme with pure black background for that clean aesthetic
- **Codeium**: Free AI code suggestions as you type
- **Avante.nvim**: AI chat for code (optional, requires API key setup)
- **Other stuff**: Bufferline for tabs, gitsigns for git integration, trouble for diagnostics, todo-comments, autopairs, surround motions, conform for formatting, toggleterm, lualine status bar

## Quick Install (One-Line Installer)

The easiest way to install nananvim:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m4c4r0n1n/nananvim/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:
- Detect your distro (Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, MacOS)
- Install all required dependencies
- Download Neovim 0.10.2+ if needed
- Clone this config to `~/.config/nvim`
- Backup your existing config if present

**Note:** If you want to review the script first: [install.sh](install.sh)

## Manual Install

If you prefer to install manually or want more control:

### 1. Backup your existing config (if you have one)

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
```

### 2. Install dependencies

**For Arch:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S git ripgrep fd imagemagick kitty nodejs npm python clang
```

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install git ripgrep fd-find imagemagick kitty nodejs npm python3 clang
# fd-find is called fdfind on Ubuntu, so symlink it:
ln -s $(which fdfind) ~/.local/bin/fd
```

### 3. Install Neovim 0.10.2+

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/v0.10.2/nvim.appimage
chmod u+x nvim.appimage
sudo mv nvim.appimage /usr/local/bin/nvim
```

### 4. Clone this config

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m4c4r0n1n/nananvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

### 5. Start Neovim

```bash
nvim
```

Lazy.nvim will (should) automatically install all plugins on first launch. Just wait for it to finish.

### 6. Check everything's working

```vim
:checkhealth
```

## Windows Users

This config is built primarily for Linux. If you're on Windows, you have some options...:

### Option 1: WSL2 (Recommended - Just Do This)

Install Ubuntu through WSL2 and follow the Ubuntu install instructions above. You'll get the full experience including image previews if you use Windows Terminal or another WSL-compatible terminal.

### Option 2: Native Windows (Not Recommended But Possible)

The config *should* work natively on Windows, but you'll need to:
- Install Neovim from the official Windows installer
- Clone to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim` instead of `~/.config/nvim`
- Manually install dependencies via Chocolatey/Scoop
- Image previews won't work (no Kitty/proper terminal support)
- Some plugins might be janky

Honestly just use WSL2 lol, it's much easier.

## What You'll Need

**The bare minimum** (config will work without these, but you'll miss features):

- **Neovim 0.10+**: The editor itself (earlier versions might work but no promises)
- **Git**: For lazy.nvim to work
- **Ripgrep & fd**: Makes file searching pretty fast
- **A Nerd Font**: For icons to display properly

**For the full experience:**

- **ImageMagick**: Required for inline image previews in Snacks picker
- **Kitty**: Terminal emulator that supports inline images (WezTerm works too with tweaks)

**For language servers and formatters:**

- **Node.js 18+**: For TypeScript/JavaScript LSP and prettier
- **Python 3.10+**: For pyright, black, isort
- **clang**: For C/C++ LSP

After setup, run `:checkhealth` to see what's working and what's missing.

## AI Features Setup

nananvim includes **free Codeium** for inline code suggestions - no setup required. If you don't want AI suggestions, you can disable Codeium by removing it from `lua/plugins/coding.lua`.

### Codeium (Inline Suggestions)

**Keybindings:**
- `<Tab>` - Accept suggestion
- `<M-]>` - Next suggestion
- `<M-[>` - Previous suggestion
- `<C-]>` - Dismiss suggestion

### Avante (AI Chat) - Optional

For AI chat (like ChatGPT in nvim), you'll need to configure a provider:

#### Option 1: FREE - Groq (Recommended)

1. Get a free API key: https://console.groq.com
2. Add to your shell:
```bash
   echo 'export GROQ_API_KEY="your-key"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
```
3. Create config override:
```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/lua/config
   nvim ~/.config/nvim/lua/config/local.lua
```
4. Add this:
```lua
   return {
     avante = {
       provider = "openai",
       providers = {
         openai = {
           endpoint = "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
           model = "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
           extra_request_body = {
             temperature = 0,
             max_tokens = 4096,
           },
         },
       },
     },
   }
```

#### Option 2: Claude (Best Quality, Costs Money)

1. Get API key: https://console.anthropic.com
2. Add to shell:
```bash
   echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
```
3. Create `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/local.lua`:
```lua
   return {
     avante = {
       provider = "claude",
       providers = {
         claude = {
           endpoint = "https://api.anthropic.com",
           model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
           extra_request_body = {
             temperature = 0,
             max_tokens = 4096,
           },
         },
       },
     },
   }
```

#### Option 3: Skip AI Chat

Just don't create `local.lua` - you'll still get:
- ✅ Free Codeium suggestions
- ✅ LSP autocomplete  
- ✅ All other features

**Avante keybindings** (only if configured):
- `<leader>aa` - Ask AI
- `<leader>ae` - Edit code with AI (visual mode)
- `<leader>ar` - Refresh
- `<leader>at` - Toggle Avante window
- `<leader>ac` - Open chat window
- `<leader>af` - Focus Avante window

## Known Issues & Bugs

There's probably some stuff I'm forgetting to tweak or haven't discovered yet. I know it, you know it, but it escapes my mind right now. If you find something broken or weird:

1. First, run `:checkhealth` to see if it's a missing dependency
2. Check if it's an LSP issue (some servers are finicky on certain distros)
3. If it's actually broken, please open an issue!

Some known quirks:

- LSP might throw some errors on first startup (especially on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS) - they usually go away after Mason finishes installing everything
- Image previews only work in Kitty (or terminals with image protocol support)
- On some systems, fd might be called `fdfind` - the Ubuntu install command handles this but if you install manually you might need to symlink it
